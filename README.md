# InCite_Public
This repository contains a public snapshot of my InCite application as of 04/26/2019. For a working live demo see https://khfsite.ddns.net/InCiteApp (password is on my private resume). For a video presentation on an older version of the app, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA03QMzNg44

The public repository does not contain any database access authorizations so the app will NOT work even if downloaded and built by yourself. Design documentations are also missing. It is here to serve as a demonstration of one of my past works for Modern Labour.

Please also note that this project was initially a team effort by the following people:

- Keh-Harng Feng (me): Team lead, data modeler, machine learning engineer, full stack developer.

- Joel Dazo: Frontend developer, quality assurance.

- Bryan Glogowski: Data mining.

Currently I am the only person developing, maintaining and hosting InCite. In terms of contribution I wrote about 80% to 90% of the code, especially for the components dealing with data wrangling, network graph generation, MVC and the search/recommendation system.
